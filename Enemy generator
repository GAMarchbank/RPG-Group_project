"""
This enemy stat calculator consists of
(1) a section to import data from the "player_data.txt and the "game_data.txt" files ,
(2) a function to determine the enemy level based on the player's level,
(3) a function to calculate the enemy loot drops, 
(4) a function to bring it all together into the "enemy stats" dictionary,
(5) a few lines of code to upload the enemy stats into a JSON file.
